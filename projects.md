## NeuralPulse Low-Latency Wearable
**Summer 2025**  
As Lead Project Engineer at **NeuralPulse**, I designed and built a wireless, watch-like device for a neuroscience experiment requiring **sub-millisecond precision**.  
- Designed schematics and PCB layout with careful RF routing.  
- Developed firmware and low-level drivers for wireless communication.  
- Designed and fabricated a 3D-printed enclosure.  
- Wrote end-to-end test and calibration procedures.  
- Navigated regulatory considerations (RoHS, UK MDR) and designed for sterilisation.

**Skills:** PCB Design (KiCad), Embedded C, RF Engineering, Test & Validation, Regulatory Design

## Weizmann Safe-Cracking Physics Competition
**2025 – Global Final 2nd Place & Judges’ Prize**  
Built a physics-based lockbox that opens only under very specific physical conditions.  
- Won UK Nationals, then placed 2nd worldwide.  
- Developed a **remote-controlled solution** when finals moved online.  
- Repurposed a 3D printer to allow internet-controlled inputs via WebSockets.

**Skills:** Mechatronics, Embedded Systems, Rapid Problem-Solving


## Home-Made Semiconductor Lab
**2024 – present**
Inspired by Sam Zeloof’s Z2 project, I began replicating his home semiconductor process.  
- Built a **tube furnace** with atmosphere control on a budget of ~£200.  
- Designed PID temperature control loops, wound custom heating elements.  
- Successfully grew oxide layers on silicon wafers.

**Skills:** Thermal Engineering, Materials Science, Power Electronics


## 8-Bit TTL Computer (SAP-2)
**2022 – present**  
Built a fully functioning 8-bit computer from **discrete TTL logic chips** based on the SAP-2 architecture.  
- Designed control logic, datapath, memory addressing, and ALU from scratch.  
- Debugged timing issues and verified Turing-completeness.  
- Used oscilloscopes and logic analyzers to trace bus states and optimise clocking.

**Skills:** Digital Electronics, Timing Analysis, Debugging, Control Logic Design


## TPU-Core PLA Filament Development
**2024 Extended Research Project**  
Developed a novel method for **co-extruding TPU core filament** inside PLA, improving impact resistance of 3D prints.  
- Designed an **Izod impact tester** to measure results.  
- Characterised filament mechanics and optimised extrusion parameters.  
- Learned structured lab methodology and data analysis.

**Skills:** Materials Testing, Data Analysis, CAD, Mechanical Design

 
## VEX Robotics (World Finalist)
**2022 – 2023**  
Competed in VEX IQ (2022) and VEX EDR (2023), reaching **World Finals** in Dallas, USA.  
- Wrote odometry and path planning algorithms enabling partial driver-record-and-replay autonomy.  
- Designed, machined, and assembled high-precision robots.  
- **Awards:**  
  - Global “Create Award” (IQ 2022) – Most Creative Engineering Solution  
  - Global “Build Award” (EDR 2023) – Best Mechanical Design & Craftsmanship

**Skills:** Robotics Design, Motion Planning, Team Leadership


## F1 in Schools – UK National Finalist
**2019 – 2023**  
Led an F1 in Schools team to **2nd place in the UK National Finals**.
