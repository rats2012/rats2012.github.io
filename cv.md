## Activities and Interests
- I enjoy designing and making devices, especially designing and working with electrical circuits, computers and microcontrollers.
- DIY 3D printer – I built a rep-rap based 3D printer in 2021 and have subsequently upgraded it in stages.
- I enjoy making small end2end devices - one example is an inventory management system I designed using RFID tags to tracks objects around a house. It worked in conjunction with ESP32 based nodes, connected to a central Raspberry Pi running a MariaDB database along with a flask backend that I wrote. It also ran a frontend written in React with Vite.
- Building a SAP2/3 8-bit breadboard computer using TTL family logic. This taught me a huge amount about debugging, high speed signalling, and electronics more generally.
- I enjoy experimenting with machine learning and AI techniques; I wrote and trained an ML based ECG noise detection algorithm.
- I have started to learn MATLAB, and have become familiar with Simulink, as I have been designing an actively controlled model rocket. Most recently, I have been learning about transfer functions and using the System Identification toolbox to accurately model actuator dynamics.
- In Summer 2021 I completed the “Neural Networks from Scratch” book and course and built a small neural networks framework in Python using the techniques I learnt. Building and expanding this codebase has given me a good intuition for how neural networks work at a mathematical level, and what happens during neural network training and inference.
- I have also recently enjoyed learning about cybersecurity and have started to learn how to penetration test using TryHackMe’s course.
- I am also an aspiring network and system administrator – at home I manage a Gen8 micro-server that hosts backups of my family’s data, and runs many services, from VPNs, to websites to an XDR and SIEM threat management system.
- I also enjoy repairing broken devices. Recently I have been accumulating broken Sonos speakers and have been performing component level board repairs to get them working and re-sell them.
- As well as hardware engineering I enjoy test engineering – from repairing devices I acquired a DS1054z oscilloscope and have been using it to test and characterize circuits using PyVisa and python.
